\section{Simplify (Q2, no need to turn in)}
Mostly just notes for myself

check out d) ($\lambda$a a)($\lambda$b f(b))

f), simplifying ($\lambda$x green(x))(y) = green(y).
Since the result holds for any y, what can you conclude about the relation between $\lambda x green(x)$ and $green$?

Same? $\lambda x green(x)$ applied to anything $y$ means that that something $y$ is green. Similarly, $green$ as a function can be applied to anything $z$ that is green. In any case, they refer to the same set of things??

wait i don't get o)

\section{(Q3) Simplify}

\subsection{John and Mary}
Given $f(John = loves(Mary, John)$

\begin{itemize}  
\item ($\lambda x loves(Mary,x)$)(John)
\item $loves(Mary, John)$ or alternatively, depending on semantics, "Mary loves John" or "John loves Mary".
\ldots 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{John loves Mary}
%In our semantics, loves(Mary,John) will be the interpretation of “John loves Mary,” not vice-versa. This is just more convenient because then the VP in that sentence has a nice, compact semantics. Namely, what?

Since loves(Mary, John) can equally mean "John loves Mary" OR "Mary loves John", we pick one interpretation to simplify the semantics. If we allow both meanings, then we end up with branching, which means twice as many ambiguous parses. 

\subsection{}
%f(John) = (∀x woman(x) ⇒ loves(x,John))

\begin{itemize}  
\item %what is f?
($\lambda j \forall x woman(x) \Rightarrow loves(x,j)$) 
\item %Translate f and f(John) into English.
Assuming that we will continue with the given semantic that loves(Mary, John) means that John loves Mary.

f : for all x, if x is a woman, then j loves x.

f(John) : for all x, if x is a woman, then John loves x.

\ldots 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{}
%Suppose f (λx loves(Mary, x)) = (λx Obviously(loves(Mary, x))). What is f and how would you use it in constructing the semantics of “Sue obviously loves Mary” Hint: Review the pop/push slide near the end of the semantics lecture.

f = $\lambda y$ Obviously(y)

In order to construct "Sue obviously loves Mary", let y = ($\lambda x loves(Mary, x)$). Then we get 


\subsection{part e}
f = $\lambda m ( \lambda j ( \lambda e$ act(e, loving), lovee(e, m), lover(e, j)))

\subsection{part f}
%Suppose g(f(Mary))(John) = (λe act(e,loving),lovee(e,Mary),lover(e,John),manner(e,passionate)). What is g? Hint: Write out f(Mary), which is the meaning of “loves Mary.” g(f(Mary)) will be the meaning of “passionately loves Mary.” Again, think about the pop/push trick.

\subsection{part g}




\section{}
I altered the parseattrs file to call
$python parse$
instead of $./parse$
In order


\section{english-fullquant.gra}
\subsection{attr}
%The new grammar gives pretty complicated semantic attributes to two and to singular and plural the. Justify the attributes it uses (i.e., explain what those lambda-terms mean). The ! symbol means “not.”

%1 Det[=1 num=pl sem="%dom %pred E%first E%second [first!=second ^ dom(first)^dom(second)] ^ pred(first) ^ pred(second)"] two

For $two$, we are ensuring that the two things that we are quantifying are not the same thing, with the $first$ and $second$ variables. Otherwise, we can end up counting a given something twice, which in reality then doesn't mean that we have two, but rather that we just counted one thing twice. 

%1 Det[=1 num=sing sem="%dom %pred E%t [dom(t) ^ !E%u u!=t ^ dom(u)] ^ pred(t)"] the

The singular $the$ idek
"the book"

%1 Det[=1 num=pl sem="%dom %pred E%T [exhaustive(T,dom)] ^ pred(T)"] the
exhaustive 
"the books"
